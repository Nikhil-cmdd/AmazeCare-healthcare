# AmazeCare üè•

A beginner-friendly **Healthcare Management System** built using:
- **Spring Boot** (Java) for the backend  
- **Angular** for the frontend  

This is my learning project as I am new to **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **Angular**.  
The goal is to explore full-stack development by building a role-based healthcare application.
